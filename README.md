<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow the step by step installation procedure to install and run this on your machine

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have node and oracle installed in your device.

**`NodeJs`**: Install Nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

**`Oracle`**:Install Oracle from [here](http://www.oracle.com/index.html) and register for an account of your own



### Installation

#### Getting the repository

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TamimEhsan/SQuirreL.git
   ```

2. If you don't have git installed in your device then download zip

3. After installation or download go to the repository and open command line.

4. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```



#### Setting up the database

1. Go to sql plus

2. Enter credentials

   ```sh
   username: sys as sysdba
   password: password
   ```

3.  Create a new user c##squirrel

   ```sh
   create user c##squirrel identified by password;
   grant dba to c##squirrel;
   ```

   

4. Find file dump.sql in `sql/SQL_DUMP.sql`

5. Head over to your favourite database GUI and connect squirrel with that

6. Import data from sql file depending upon the GUI. 

7. The DUMP should work i hope ðŸ˜©

8. If no errors are shown we are good to go!



#### Setting up the environment variables

create a new file `.env` in the root directory. And the file should have the followings

```sh
DB_USER= YOUR_DB_USER 
DB_PASS= YOUR_DB_PASS
DB_CONNECTSTRING=localhost/orcl
PORT=YOUR_FABOURITE_PORT
APP_SECRET=YOUR_DARKEST_SECRET
```

If you followed the above then the `.env` should look like this

```sh
DB_USER= c##squirrel 
DB_PASS= password
DB_CONNECTSTRING=localhost/orcl
PORT= 3000
APP_SECRET=iLoveSquirrel
```



#### Getting the big static data

We are almost done. As there are size restrictions of files, we couldn't upload the images in github ðŸ˜ª. So go to  :arrow_forward: [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9d5But_VUcviEykeNlIUvejf0JQnAQY/view?usp=sharing) :arrow_backward: and download the images. paste the folder in public/images. The directory tree should be like this

```sh
SQuirreL/
â”œâ”€ middlewares/
â”œâ”€ public/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ css/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ images/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ books/
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ 10000001.jpg
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ 10000002.jpg
â”‚  â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ favicon.png
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ ...
â”‚  â”œâ”€ scripts/
â”œâ”€ router/

```

We are finally good to go
